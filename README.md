### 1. Sign languages prediction for days of a week
* This project aims to classify sign language gestures for the days of the week using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), This was trained by using Google’s Mediapipe Library to Predict the days of a week.
### 2. Emotion detection using Deepface
* This project is about human facial emotion detection using Facebook’s Deep Face library, it predicts the emotion of human beings.
### 3. Rep counter using Mediapipe
* This project uses the OpenCV library to detect and track the movement of an object, such as a weight or a human limb, within a video stream.
### 4. Classification of Retinopathy
* This project deals with retinopathy, by using the deep learning architecture such as CNN it predicts and classifies the levels of retinopathy.
### 5. Knee bend exercise
* This project uses the OpenCV library to detect and track the body movements and calculate the knee bending time for the people.
