#### 3. Rep counter using Mediapipe
* This project uses the OpenCV library to detect and track the movement of an object, such as a weight or a human limb, within a video stream.
#### 4. Classification of Retinopathy
* This project deals with retinopathy, by using the deep learning architecture such as CNN it predicts and classifies the levels of retinopathy.
#### 5. Knee bend exercise
* This project uses the OpenCV library to detect and track body movements and calculate the knee bending time for the people.
#### 6. Slub Analysis
* This project calculates the distance between slubs, representing the difference between the excellent thread and uneven thread areas in garments.
